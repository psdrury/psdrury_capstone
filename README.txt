Executive Summary
The main theme of this project will be “Baseball through the Eras”. It will examine the offensive output as well as pitching of teams and certain top individual players throughout the major sub eras that comprise the “Modern Era” of baseball. These eras include:
1.	The Dead Ball Era (1901-1919)
2.	The Live Ball Era (1920-1941)
3.	The Integration Era (1942-1960)
4.	The Expansion Era (1961-1976)
5.	The Free Agency Era (1977-1993)
6.	The Longball/Steroid Era (1994-2005)
7.	The Post Steroid Era (2005-Present)

Motivation
Baseball is not only America’s pastime and my personal favorite sport, but it has been using data and stats to inform its governing bodies and fanbases for over 140 years. It is a sport where every fan is an amateur data analyst, whether it is collecting and comparing box scores, or even their fantasy baseball team. With such a long and storied history, baseball has a wealth of data to delve in to and so many questions to be asked and answers to be found. This project will be delving into the 7 periods of time that make up Baseball’s Modern Era, more specifically, offensive output and the effect each era had on it. It will also touch on pitching statistics and how they have been affected by the offensive output of each era.
